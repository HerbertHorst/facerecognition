/**
 * Task that searches the faces the user marked by hand for a descriptor. A
 * manual face carries no model descriptor, so it cannot participate in
 * clustering on its own. For each marking that waits for it, this task crops
 * the marked region from the original photo and runs face detection on just
 * that crop (see ManualFaceDetector).
 *
 * If a face is found, the marking takes its descriptor, its box and the
 * confidence the detector gave it, and from then on the clustering treats it
 * like any other face, minimums included. If no face can be detected on the
 * marked region, only in the margin around it, or none at all, the face is
 * simply excluded from clustering: it stays pinned
 * to its person, if it has one. No fallback descriptor is fabricated.
 *
 * Nothing that goes wrong here leaves the task: the background job treats any
 * exception of a task as fatal, and would stop the analysis and the clustering
 * of every user with it. A marking that fails is recorded as having no face,
 * so it is not tried again on every run.
