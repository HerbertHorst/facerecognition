/**
 * Searches a region of a photo the user marked for faces: cuts the region, with
 * a margin, out of the original photo, scales it (see analysisArea()), runs
 * the detector on it, and gives the faces back in pixels of the original
 * photo.
 *
 * Why a crop helps even though the full photo was already analysed: the full
 * photo is downscaled to the model's maximum area before detection, so a small
 * face can fall below the detector's size threshold and be missed. The crop is
 * not downscaled as far, or even scaled up, so the same face is large enough
 * to be detected, and its descriptor is comparable to descriptors from
 * full-image detections (dlib aligns the face before computing it).
 *
 * Scaling up only helps the detector: the descriptor is computed from a chip
 * of 150 x 150 pixels, and a face of 40 pixels holds what 40 pixels hold, at
 * any scale. So the crop is scaled up no more than the detector needs, which
 * keeps the search fast and adds no interpolated detail the detector could
 * take for a face.
 *
 * A face drawn by hand and a region to search again both go through here, so
 * that orientation, mime type and the way back to the coordinates of the photo
 * are handled once. What is done with the faces found is up to each of them.
